					<p>I started developing websites since early 2015 and have been rapidly expanding my knowledge in both front and back end development. Html, Css, Javascript/JQuery and Php are the languages I have become most familiar with and use on almost every project I have worked on.</p>

					<p>My most enjoyable hobby is playing an old game called Super Smash Brother's Melee competitively. As a 10 year veteran in this community, I have traveled all over the United States and Canada to prove my talent and be recognized on a global scale. Here is a recording of one of my finals matches.</p>

					<p>There's is nothing more gratifying than finally landing that flip trick into grind down the hand rail that you have been practicing for weeks. No matter how big or how small the manuver, skateboarding requires a lot of discipline and persistence to improve. I like to carry these traits into anything I get into.</p>
